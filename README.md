# Jupyter Notebooks

Repo for miscellaneous Python resources using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) (formerly IPython Notebook).

Notebooks will [render on GitHub](https://blog.jupyter.org/2015/05/07/rendering-notebooks-on-github/), and for more complicated use cases there is [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).

Better yet, open this repo on Binder:

###### Tools

* [Pineapple](https://nwhitehead.github.io/pineapple/) is a nice standalone frontend for OS X, but it currently doesn't support Anaconda
* [Rodeo](http://rodeo.yhat.com/) is a nice data science IDE

* [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) looks like a nice version manager, but not sure how it works with Anaconda
